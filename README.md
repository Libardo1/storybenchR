## Exploring tidy tools with `fivethirtyeight` (storybench)

### *Welcome to the `tidyverse`*

The [`tidyverse`](http://tidyverse.org/) is a collection of R packages developed by RStudio's Chief Scientist [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). These packages work well together as part of larger data analysis pipeline. To learn more about these tools and how they work together, read [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
