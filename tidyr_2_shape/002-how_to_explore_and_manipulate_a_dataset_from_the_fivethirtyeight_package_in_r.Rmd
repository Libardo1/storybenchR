# How to explore and manipulate a dataset from the fivethirtyeight package in R

The [fivethirtyeight](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html) R package – released by Albert Y. Kim, Chester Ismay, and Jennifer Chunn last March – contains [dozens of datasets](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data) used in FiveThirtyEight news articles like " [A Handful Of Cities Are Driving 2016’s Rise In Murders](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-handful-of-cities-are-driving-2016s-rise-in-murders/)", " [The Best MLB All-Star Teams Ever](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-mlb-all-star-teams-ever/) ", and  " [The Dallas Shooting Was Among The Deadliest For Police In U.S. History](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dallas-shooting-was-among-the-deadliest-for-police-in-u-s-history/)."  This tutorial will explore the murder_2015_final dataset using tidyr principles like tibble, gather, arrange and separate from our [tidyverse](http://www.storybench.org/getting-started-with-tidyverse-in-r/) tutorial.

## Install and load the package

Using RStudio, we’ll install and then load the `fivethirtyeight` package, as well as `tidyr`, `tibble` and `dplyr` and then call `murder_2015_final`. 
```{r packages_2}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
murder_2015_final <- fivethirtyeight::murder_2015_final %>% tbl_df()
murder_2015_final %>% glimpse()
```

## Look at the dataset’s column names

Use `names(murder_2015_final)` to list out the dataset’s column names.

```{r names}
# See names of columns
names(murder_2015_final)
```


![murder_2015_final_names](./murder_2015_final_names.png)

## Gather variables into a single column

Lets gather up the two year variables, `murders_2014` and `murders_2015` into a single year column we’ll name murder_year. We’ll store the number of murders in a column titled murders and call this new object `murders_gathered`.

```{r murders_gathered, results='hide'}
murders_gathered <- murder_2015_final %>% 
    gather(
        key = murder_year,
        value = murders,
        murders_2014:murders_2015,
        na.rm = TRUE)
murders_gathered
```

![02-murderstibble](02-murderstibble.png)

## Arrange data alphabetically by state and city

Now let’s arrange this data alphabetically by state and city. We can do this with `arrange()` from the `dplyr` package. (We’ll learn more about `dplyr` in the next tutorial!)

```{r murders_arranged, results='hide'}
murders_arranged <- murders_gathered %>% 
    arrange(
        state, 
        city)
murders_arranged
```

![03-murdersarranged](03-murdersarranged.png)

So now we have the two years in a single column (`murder_year`), but the repeating `murder_ text` is redundant. I want to get the year in a column by itself.

## Separate `murder_year` column into `text` and `year`

Now I want to put the murder years (2014 & 2015) back into two different columns. I’ll do this with `separate()`.

The `separate()` command uses a name of the existting column we want to separate (`murder_year`), and the names of the columns that will contain the separated values (`c("text", "year")`).

```{r murders_separate, results='hide'}
murders_separate <- murders_arranged %>%
    separate(
        murder_year,
            into = c("text", 
                     "year")
        )
murders_separate
```

Great. Now I can use `spread()` to put the year back into two different columns, `2014` & `2015`. But I will combine this with `arrange()` so the output is easier to read.

```{r murders_spread, results='hide'}
murders_spread <- murders_separate %>% 
    spread(
        year,
        murders
        ) %>% 
        arrange(
            state,
            city)
murders_spread
```


![](04-murders_spread.png)

What if I want to combine `city` and `state` into a single column `city_state`?

## Using unite to paste one column into another

The final command, `unite()`, lets me paste the contents of columns onto one another. It requires the name of the new column `city_state` and the columns I want to combine `city` and `state`. But I want to sort this new tibble in descending order of change, and I want to remove the text variable.

I can combine all of these together with the pipe (`%>%`).

```{r murders_final}
murders_final <- murders_spread %>%
unite(
    city_state, 
    city, 
    state) %>% 
        arrange(
            city_state
            ) %>% 
            select(
                -(text)
                )
murders_final
```


## Output the new table as a csv

Use `write.csv(murders_final, file = "murders_final.csv",row.names=FALSE, na="")` and voilá, you have a csv.

```{r write.csv, results='hide'}
write.csv(murders_final, file = "murders_final.csv",row.names = FALSE, na = "")
```

```{r source}
download.file()
```


## A recap of what we learned

We used the pipe operator to string together various `tidyr` and `dplyr` functions for structuring our data (in tibbles). Remember that:

- `gather()` collects data across columns and puts it into into rows  
- `arrange()` sorts the data in each column  
- `separate()` divides the contents of a column apart into new columns  
- `spread()` distributes data from rows into columns  
- `unite()` attaches the contents from one column onto the contents of another column

## A quick barplot

By typing `murders_final %>% ggplot(aes(change)) + geom_bar()`, you can create a quick barplot of the change in murders by city.

```{r geom_bar}
barplot(murders_final$change)
# murders_final %>% ggplot(aes(change)) + geom_bar()
```

![07-barplot-change-1200x742](07-barplot-change-1200x742.png)

Obviously, the barplot is not visualizing the "change" column sorted low to high. To do that, try your hand with `arrange()`.

```{r murders_final_sort}
murders_final_sort <- murders_final %>% 
  arrange(
    change)
murders_final_sort
```

Then, plotting `barplot(murders_final_sort$change)` will produce this:

```{r sorted_barplot}
barplot(murders_final_sort$change)
```


![08-sort-plot-1200x767](08-sort-plot-1200x767.png)
To extend the y-axis to -20, add:

```{r ylim}
barplot(murders_final_sort$change,
        ylim = c(-20, 120))
```

Finally, we’ll add some labels. There are many different ways to add labels in R. Here’s one way:

```{r midpts}
midpts <- barplot(murders_final_sort$change,
                  cex.axis = 1.0, 
                  cex.names = 0.6,
                  ylim = c(-20, 120), 
                  main = "Change in murders from 2014 to 2015")

text(murders_gathered$city,
     x = midpts,
     offset = -0.1,
     y = -20,
     cex = 0.5,
     srt = 60,
     xpd = TRUE,
     pos = 2) 
```
